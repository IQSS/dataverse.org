            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>The Dataverse is an open source web application to share, preserve, cite, explore and analyze research data. 
            It facilitates making data available to others, and allows you to replicate others work. 
            Researchers, data authors, publishers, data distributors, and affiliated institutions all receive appropriate credit.</p>
<p>A Dataverse repository hosts multiple dataverses. Each dataverse contains datatset or other dataverses, and each dataset contains 
descriptive metadata and data files (including documentation and code that accompany the data). </p>
            <h2>A Collaboration with Harvard Library, Harvard University IT, and IQSS</h2>
            <p>Since 2012, the Institute for Quantitative Social Science has collaborated with Harvard Library and Harvard 
            University Information Technology (HUIT) to make the <a href="http://dataverse.harvard.edu">Harvard Dataverse</a> openly 
            available to researchers and data collectors worldwide from all disciplines to deposit data. In this collaboration
            IQSS leads the development of the open source Dataverse software; and in conjunction with the 
            <a href="http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/odap/home">Open Data Assistance Program at Harvard</a> (a collaboration with Harvard Library, the Office for 
            Scholarly Communication and IQSS) provides user support for the Harvard Dataverse. The Library Technology Services
            at HUIT provides hosting and backups support of the Harvard Dataverse.</p>
            <h2>History of the Project</h2>
            <p>The Dataverse software is being developed by the <a href="http://datascience.iq.harvard.edu">Data Science</a> team at Harvard's <a href="http://iq.harvard.edu/data-science-team">Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS)</a>. 
            Coding of the Dataverse Network software began in 2006 under the leadership of Mercè Crosas and Gary King. 
            We benefited considerably from our experience with our earlier Virtual Data Center (VDC) project, which spanned 1999-2006 
            and was organized by Micah Altman, Gary King, and Sidney Verba as a collaboration between the Harvard-MIT Data Center 
            (now part of IQSS) and the Harvard University Library. Precursors to the VDC date to 1987, comprising such entities as 
            a stand-alone software guide to local data, preweb software, and tools to transfer cataloging information by FTP to other 
            sites across campus automatically at designated times.</p>
            <h2>The Development Team at IQSS</h2>
            The core of the development of Dataverse continues to take place at IQSS. However, the project has a growing open-source 
            community from a number of institutions around the world, who contributes to improve and expand the software.
