Dataverse Community Norms
=================================

CC0 License for Datasets
---------------------------------------------
By default, all datasets added into Dataverse are granted the CC0 license. Dataverse uses CC0 as its default license because CC0 has name recognition in the scientific community, making it a familiar option for data (for which in general copyright does not apply), and is in use by repositories as well as scientific journals that require the deposit of open data. For more information on CC0, please visit the Creative Commons website (http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0). Data depositors can change this license for their datasets, if needed.


*Dataverse asks that all users who download datasets from Dataverseâ€™s services follow the following Community Norms*.* 


Crediting any research used with data citations
------------------------------------------------

Any materials (books, articles, conference papers, theses, dissertations, reports, and other such publications) created that employ, reference, or otherwise utilize the data (in whole or in part) gathered from deposited datasets should credit the source with the applicable data citation generated by Dataverse (found on the dataset page). These citations include the data authors, data identifier, and other information in accordance with the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (http://force11.org/datacitation) for all research data. To find out more, visit our Data Citation Best Practices guide (http://best-practices.dataverse.org/data-citation/).

Maintaining anonymity of human subjects
-----------------------------------------------

Users of the Service should not abuse the available data that relate to human subjects and use the materials to:
 
1) obtain information that could directly or indirectly identify any research subjects, or obtain information to attempt to directly or indirectly identify any research subjects; 
2) produce and/or publish connections among datasets that could identify individuals or organizations; or 
3) obtain (additional) information about or (additional) means of contact for already-identified subjects. 

\* **Legal Disclaimer:** these Community Norms are not a substitute for the CC0 or custom licenses applicable to each dataset. Please be advised that the Community Norms are not a binding contractual agreement, and that downloading datasets from Dataverse does not create a legal obligation to follow these policies.
