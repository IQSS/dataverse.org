*Information Collected Through Your Use of the Harvard Dataverse Application*

When you access this web site, our web server software generates logfiles of the IP

deleted completely from our systems. When you download a file from Harvard Dataverse, our
software collects user account data such as your name, username, email, institution and position
if provided (or the session ID data for guest users) and accompanying download data such as the
time of the download. This information is then made available to the dataverse administrator,
dataset manager, and dataset curator of the file.

We also use Google Analytics to collect data on how our users are using Harvard
Dataverse so that we can improve its functionality. Please see the Google Analytics Privacy
Policy (http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html?rd=2) and Terms of Use
(http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/) for information on how Google handles these
data.

time do we disclose site usage by individual users.

With the exception of the data collected during downloads, which are made available
only to the file owner, we do not share any personally identifiable information we gather or
develop about our users to any third parties for any purpose unless required by law. Any reports
we may share externally would use unidentifiable, aggregated data.
