USER UPLOADS

SERVICES
*******************

The Service provides you with the ability to post User Uploads and display, organize, accept and distribute User Uploads by creating a dataverse. The Service provides you with the ability to post User Uploads to other dataverses administered by other Users. 

The Service also gives each Administrator the ability to change dataset access/download restrictions by designating User Uploads as Restricted User Submissions. Datasets are by default unpublished, but Administrators can modify the access restrictions and Publish or deaccession any User Uploads at any time. Depending on the permissions granted by the Administrator of the Dataverse in question, Depositors may also change dataset access/download restrictions by designating User Uploads as Restricted User Submissions. 

Harvard Dataverse has no obligation to monitor the Site, Service, Content, or User Uploads. Harvard Dataverse may remove any User Upload at any time for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such User Upload), or for no reason at all.

You acknowledge that Harvard Dataverse does not endorse, take responsibility for, or make any representations or warranties for any User Uploads, and will not be liable for 1) User Upload content, format, Metadata, or lack thereof; 2) representations or warranties made by the User about the User Uploads; and 3) any loss of or damage to User Uploads, either in whole or in part, from whatever cause.

RESTRICTIONS
************

In contributing Content to the site, you must ensure that the Content complies with the Terms of Use. If your User Upload does not comply with the Terms of Use, Harvard Dataverse has the right in its sole discretion to take down your User Upload. Harvard Dataverse does not review all User Uploads before they are made available on the Site, or before they are Published. Therefore, you will be held legally and financially responsible for all damages if Content you contribute violates anything in this Agreement. 

By posting User Uploads to your dataverse or other dataverses, or by allowing others to do so, you make the following representations and warranties to Harvard Dataverse:

 #. User Uploads do not infringe upon the copyrights or other intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity or other right of any third party;
 #. User Uploads do not violate any laws;
 #. in the event you become aware of any issues after submitting a User Upload, you will promptly notify Harvard Dataverse and the relevant dataverse Administrator(s) of any confidentiality, privacy or data protection, licensing, or intellectual property issues regarding the User Uploads;
 #. User Uploads do not contain software viruses or any other computer codes, files, or programs that are designed or intended to disrupt, damage, limit or interfere with the proper function of any software, hardware, or telecommunications equipment or to damage or obtain unauthorized access to any system, data files, or other information of Harvard Dataverse or any third party;
 #. User Uploads have been given all relevant, obligatory, and applicable approvals for posting such materials with the content included and in the format uploaded, including but not limited to approvals from the Institutional Review Board and third parties with whom Users have relevant contractual obligations; and
 #. User Uploads must be void of all identifiable information, such that re-identification of any subjects from the amalgamation of the information available from all of the materials (across datasets and dataverses) uploaded under any one author and/or User should not be possible. Specifically, User Uploads cannot contain social security numbers; credit card numbers; medical record numbers; health plan numbers; other account numbers of individuals; or biometric identifiers (fingerprints, retina, voice print, DNA, etc.). The only exceptions for when identifiable information is allowed are when:

     a.	the information has been previously released to the public;
     b.	the information describes public figures, where the data relates to their public roles or other non-sensitive subjects;
     c.	a sufficient length of time has passed since the collection of the information;
     d.	all identified subjects have given explicit informed consent allowing the public release of the information in the dataset; or
     e.	all identified subjects are deceased and no federal statute explicitly restricts the release of the data (this exception is only for federal records where data is created by a U.S. federal government agency or under a federal contract).
