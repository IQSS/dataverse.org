Replication Guidelines
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. **Preparing data for replication:** What should be included and considered to ensure proper data replication?

 A) Add all relevant descriptive metadata in your replication Dataset in Dataverse.

   * Publication citation: Including a permanent link to the original
     publication(s) (e.g., journal article, dissertation, etc) based on the data.
   * Data Citation Details:
      * Title of the Dataset: 
      * Author(s)
      * Publication date: automatically generated in Dataverse when you publish your Dataset.
      * Persistent Identifier (DOI): automatically generated in Dataverse when you create a Dataset.
   * Description and Scope
      * Description/abstract taken directly from your publication.
      * Keywords
   * Data Collection / Methodology: Add more descriptive metadata to
     explain how the data was collected and analyzed.
   * License + Terms of Access: In order to reduce all limitations to sharing
     and reuse the Dataverse recommends whenever possible that your Datasets have a `CC0
     public domain dedication <https://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_use_for_data>`_. Our Community Norms as well as good scientific practices require that proper credit is given via citation.

    

 B) Add all relevant files (Research Data, Documentatio, Code and Analysis Files) in a replication Dataset in your Dataverse.

   * List of code, scripts, documents and data files that are needed in order to make replication possible. 
   * Create a replication dataset: 
      * Deposit preferred or commonly used file formats in your
        discipline to ensure that others will be able to more easily
        replicate your research. Please remember to remove information
        from your datasets that must remain confidential (ex. names of
        survey respondents). For **Astronomy/Astrophysics**: FITS
        files with image metadata stored in a human-readable ASCII
        header. For the **Social Sciences**: Original SPSS, STATA, R
        files, csv, xslx, etc with variable names and description.
   * Sets of computer program recodes (if needed).
   * Program commands, code or script for analysis (if needed).
   * Extracts of existing publicly available data (or very clear directions for how to obtain exactly the same ones you used).
   * Documentation files (full set of supporting documentation)
       * “readme” file (explanatory document on how to use the files to replicate the study)
       * Text/pdf file of the article (if no subscription required).
       * Include a list of links to software or newly generated software used to replicate the data (see Gary King's website for examples).
       * Codebook
       * Data collection instruments
       * Summary statistics
       * Project summaries
       * Bibliographies of publications pertaining to the data

2. **Citing for replication**

 Use the data citation generated by your replication Dataset in Dataverse and add it as the first footnote or in the References within your publication to indicate where researchers can access your replication data. The persistent URL (ex. http://dx.doi.org/...) will link to a specific dataset in your Dataverse, and the dataset will contain everything needed for replication.
