Dataverse Authentication and Authorization Community Group
===========================================================

The Dataverse Authentication and Authorization Community Group ("Auth" for short) reports on the state and future of authentication and authorization in installations of Dataverse to the :ref:`Dataverse Advisory Team <advisory-team>`. It is coordinated by `Philip Durbin <http://www.iq.harvard.edu/people/philip-durbin>`__ and `Ben Companjen <https://pure.knaw.nl/portal/en/persons/ben-companjen%280db8708d-9b7d-44f5-b960-521261d8b2f9%29.html>`__.

At the group's first face-to-face meeting on June 10, 2015, we decided that people interested in auth should continue to use the `dvn-auth <https://lists.iq.harvard.edu/pipermail/dvn-auth/2013-September/000000.html>`__ mailing list, though different communication channels are still being considered. Suggestions are welcome!

As the living documentation of the group's interests and activities we keep a `Dataverse Authentication and Authorization Community Group Google Doc <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xbWkj_OIk13gKe7jleNXVvakZErvHLA8JRBvLz8Fe8Q/edit?usp=sharing>`__. Anyone can see and comment on this document - if you want to edit, please ask Phil or Ben.
