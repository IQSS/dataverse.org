Dataverse Authentication and Authorization Community Group
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Dataverse Authentication and Authorization Community Group ("Auth" for short) reports on the state and future of authentication and authorization in installations of Dataverse to the :ref:`Dataverse Advisory Team <advisory-team>`. It is coordinated by `Philip Durbin <http://www.iq.harvard.edu/people/philip-durbin>`__ and Ben Companjen.

Currently, people interested in auth are subscribed to the `dvn-auth <https://lists.iq.harvard.edu/pipermail/dvn-auth/2013-September/000000.html>`__ mailing list but different communication channels are being considered. Suggestions are welcome!
